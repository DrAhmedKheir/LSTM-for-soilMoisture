About Dataset
This dataset provides remote sensing observations of soil moisture for the year 2013, specifically for regions within Germany. The data captures various attributes that are essential for understanding and modeling soil moisture dynamics.

Features:

time: Timestamp of the observation.
latitude: Latitude coordinate of the observation location.
longitude: Longitude coordinate of the observation location.
clay_content: Percentage of clay content in the soil.
sand_content: Percentage of sand content in the soil.
silt_content: Percentage of silt content in the soil.
sm_aux: Soil moisture observation from the SMOS-ASCAT satellite (smoothed).
sm_tgt: Soil moisture observation from the AMSR satellite.
Context:

Soil moisture is a critical variable in hydrology, agriculture, and climate science. Remote sensing provides an effective way to monitor soil moisture across large areas. This dataset, focusing on Germany for the year 2013, offers insights into the spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture and its relation to soil properties.

Use Cases:

Understanding the distribution and dynamics of soil moisture across Germany.
Investigating the relationship between soil properties (clay, sand, silt content) and soil moisture.
Developing predictive models for soil moisture using remote sensing data.
Comparing observations from different satellite sources.
